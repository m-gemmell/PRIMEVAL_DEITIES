The CGC is the Centre for Genomics and Cloning.
They are a worldwide institute with a focus on healthcare.
They hope to fix all the world's ailments with genetic engineering and if that doesn't work they clone new body parts.

Although a lot of their bespoke treatment is too expensive for normal citizens a lot of their breakthroughs have been adopted throughout the industry.
Unknown to the public, the company was inspired by the mutations in the DOT and create their own mutants for various purposes.

## CGC SCIENTIST {#scientist}

PANIC 4: Consumes their CGC serum

- Lab coat
- Lab book full of encrypted jargon
- Intelligent individual with imposter syndrome
- CGC serum (1 use)

__ENGAGED:__ Science is the greatest calling in the world and the greatest calling in science is from the CGC.
Altering and creating new life, the possibilities are endless.
The CGC SCIENTIST loves their work and hates the boundaries set by society and its ethics.
The CGC frequently pushes and breaks these boundaries.
Within their lab and with the right price the CGC SCIENTIST can swap a character's trait for any other, once per character.

__KEEPERS:__ Their primary purpose is to contain specimens.
Their frequent handling of the various mutated animals and clones have left them scarred and hardened to force.
CGC SECURITY do not want to harm anyone or anything, preferring to subdue and capture.

__NON-LETHAL__ weapon tag: Does not deal DAMAGE; has a 3-in-1D6 chance to knock unconscious on a success. ([F:UE](https://claymorerpgs.itch.io/fist))
