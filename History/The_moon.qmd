Space travel was expedited due to the world governments working together to carry it out. The Japanese refugees took this as an opportunity to create a new home as the first settlers on the moon at the start of the 1960s. They are now known as Mooners.

They have 2 major metropolises there called **Usagi** (Rabbit) and **Kaguya**. They specialise in combustion light-gas guns (large cannons with high velocity), hydrogen batteries, and mecha. When they are ready they plan to take back Japan.

## CARGO MECHA {#cargo_mecha}

10 HP | 2 ARMOR

-   Stainless steel plating (2 ARMOR)
-   Self destruct, 10 second timer (2D6 DAMAGE)
-   Bipedal mecha lacking a head
-   Frame of steel beams and rods
-   10-15 feet tall
-   Torso with cockpit for one pilot

**GASHAPON:** Able to fit inside a standard 20ft by 8ft shipping container these mecha can be easily hidden and deployed. With rudimentary AI they self assemble and then help the pilot into their cockpit. They are highly customisable, when one is encountered roll 1D6 on each of the "Mecha gear tables" to determine their gear and legs.

**FRAIL:** When the **CARGO MECHA** is reduced to 0 HP it can no longer function. Additionally, any excess damage when it reaches 0 HP is taken by the pilot.
