Troops used by Nyxmera based organisations.
Used for a variety of reasons including body guards, security, and mercenaries.

## NYXMERA TROOPER {#nyxmera_tropper}

(3 HP, 2D6 appear)

3 HP | 1 ARMOR | 2D6 appear | EYES : +1 | JAWS : 0 | LIMBS : -1 | NERVES : +1

- Semi-Auto Laser rifle (Choose 1 of 2D6 DAMAGE, 1D6 DAMAGE for other users)
- Meteorite scrap metal armor (1 ARMOR)
- Rifle mounted light (Directional close range sight in the dark)
- Black and white fatigues, covered in scraps of meteor metal.

__DUALITY:__ These troopers embody the day and night extremes of Nyxmera. They will shoot allies and enemies alike with their laser rifles. When dealing damage with these they harm the target on even totals and heal the target on odd totals. Normally the referee will choose which die to use. However, if a player adds one or more WAR DICE they choose which single dice to remove from the DAMAGE.

## NYXMERA LIGHT TROOPER {#nyxmera_light_tropper}

(3 HP, 1D6 appear)

3 HP | 2 ARMOR | 1D6 appear | EYES : +1 | JAWS : +1 | LIMBS : -1 | NERVES : -1

- Laser shotgun (1D6+1 DAMAGE)
- 1D6 stun grenades (temporary blinding, one use)
- Helmet mounted lantern (close range sight in the dark)
- Meteorite metal armor (2 ARMOR)
- Hard light projector (1 use)

__STEADFAST:__ These heavy troopers stand strong against the dark. They routinely use the combination of their lanterns and hard light projectors to corner enemies.

__Hardlight wall generator__ weapon: A heavy 2 handed device that can create a 2 ARMOR 5 foot tall by 10 foot wide hard light wall projection 10 feet in front of the device. It must be continuously fired whilst the user is illuminated. Due to the weight of the hard light the wall must be kept on the ground for normal humans. The hard light is frictionless and so can be moved slowly by the user.


## NYXMERA DARK TROOPER {#nyxmera_dark_trooper}

6 HP | 1 ARMOR | 1D6 appear | EYES : +1 | JAWS : 0 | LIMBS : +1 | NERVES : 0

- Meteorite sword (1D6+1 DAMAGE, LIGHT)
- Night vision goggles (see at night)
- Light diffraction weave bodysuit (1 ARMOR, difficult to see)
- Shadow boots (Can teleport from one shadow to another within a range of 30 feet, 1 use)
- Deployable hard light hoverboard (accessory)

__PATIENT:__ The dark trooper will watch and stalk enemies. It will bide its time for the best opportunity to reveal itself based on how cool it would be. If it begins a fight with no backup it will take no DAMAGE from the first attack against them, doing a narly flip or trick to evade it.

__LIGHT__ weapon tag: Weighs almost nothing. Grants +1 on REFLEXIVE rolls that involve this weapon. ([F:UE](https://claymorerpgs.itch.io/fist))
