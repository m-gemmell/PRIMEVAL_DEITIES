This takes time so they want the raider trouble taken care of at the source.\n\nThe team's mission is to prevent further raids from occurring.\n\nThe real threat is that [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) are currently trying to reawaken the extinct volcano.\nThey have attacked the Raider settlement, preventing any interference.\n\n## Reward\n\nIf successful the military will reward the team with all or some of the below items and a base upgrade (based on your system).\n\n[Kukri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukri) (1D6+1 DAMAGE, MENACING, THIRSTY)\n\n__MENACING__ weapon tag: Enemies who see a comrade slain by this weapon have a 1-in-1D6 chance to flee.\n\n__THIRSTY__ weapon tag: Once this weapon is unsheathed, the weapon cannot be dropped by the user. Only once the weapon has drawn blood can it be sheathed and let go by the user.\n\n1D6 MP5s (1D6 DAMAGE)\n\n[Westland Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Lynx) military helicopter (16 HP, 1 ARMOR). It is a damaged prototype that will need to be repaired by the team.\n\n## Start of mission\n\nThe players will drive through Warboy to see the devastation brought upon it by the DOT raiders.\nThey will then be brought to the ad hoc base camp set up by the military.\nAn unfriendly lieutenant will give a brief introduction to the situation.\nThe lieutenant will warn the team that a recon force was sent down who have not returned.\n\n## The Expedition\n\nThe players will go into the DOT to complete the mission.\nThey can also ask the military for some gear, this will require some good rolls and/or bargaining.\n\n## The DOT\n\nThis part of the DOT looks similar to a limestone cave with stalagmites (floor), stalactites (ground), and columns. \nHowever, the rock is made of [Diorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diorite), a \"salt and pepper\" coloured rock.\nIt is created from magma and found locally around Warboys due to the extinct volcano.\nMagma drips from the stalactites sizzling and solidifying into Diorite.\nLarger amounts of magma appears as the team goes deeper into the cave.\nAlthough dangerous it provides a low level of light.\n\n## Map\n\n![](images/DELVE_caves.png){width=500px fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## The Descent {#descent}\n\nThe first obstacle once entering the DOT is [the Descent](#descent).\nThe raiders have put some shoddy metal steps into the steep and jagged rock surface.\n\nAsk the players how they approach this and let the consequences happen.\n\n## Overlook Chamber {#overlook_chamber}\n\nA large open chamber. \nA still quiet here allows the team to investigate the rock structures and decide their plan of action.\n\nThe team will notice piles of cooled magma with pieces of Obsidian.\nUnder close inspection they are shaped like bodies with no heads.\nThese are dead [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) that were sniped by the [TARTARUS MAGNETIC SLINGER](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#magnetic_slinger) in the Overlook window.\n\n### Overlook window\n\nA large window high up overlooks the chamber.  There is one [TARTARUS MAGNETIC SLINGER](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#magnetic_slinger) and one [TARTARUS RAIDER](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#raider) overlooking the chamber.\nThe window connects directly to the Raider's chamber via a tight passage.\n\nThe pair will stay hidden and silent.\nWhilst the Slinger keeps overlook the raider will go back and forth to relay messages between the overlook and Raider leader at the [Raider's chamber](#raider_chamber).\n\nThey will engage the team and call for reinforcements if the team try to destroy any of the cave routes.\n\n## The Squeeze {#squeeze}\n\nThis passage is a long winding jagged squeeze.\nThere are no enemies but characters who go through this will have to leave items behind to make the squeeze.\nOnce in deep enough they can only go forward.\nNormal sized characters can only bring through one weapon, one piece of body armor, and one other piece of gear (grenade, medkit etc).\nThey cannot bring helmets, shields, or other large rigid items.\n\n## The Relief {#relief}\n\nA dark chamber with no magma and no light.\n\nA trail of blood leads from the [Killing Floor](#killing_floor) to a hidden alcove within a [Bismuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth) column, this is where the [METAL ORE TALOS](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#ore_talos) in the [Killing Floor](#killing_floor) emerged from.\nWithin it lays a deceased member of the military recon team, riddled with heavy machine gun fire.\nThe only usable equipment they have is a __Zip line shooter__.\n\n__Zip line shooter__: One use per mission. Gun like device to fire a deployable 30 metre zip line. \nThe user should be careful as titanium anchoring bolts fire out both ends to fix the zip line to a start and an end surface.\n\n## The Dome\n\nA large chamber with a dome shaped ceiling that meets the floor.\nThe room is littered with stalagmites, stalactites, and columns.\nAt the very top of the dome there is an oculus made of Obsidian, a distraction.\n\nWhen the majority of the team enters the centre of the chamber 2D6 hidden [LITHIUM TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#litium_talos) will ambush them.\n1d6 are on the floor whilst the other 1D6 are on the ceiling.\nThe Taloes are slow and will try to position themselves in good positions before unleashing their explosive spit.\nThis may give the team a bit of time to react.\n\nWhen the taloes die the resulting explosions will cause stalagmites and stalactites to fall.\nThese will may cause 1D6 damage if not evaded.\n\n## The River {#river}\n\nThis chamber is split in half by a river of magma.\nEruptions of magma regularly break the surface, dealing 1D6 damage.\nJagged rocks and magma dripping from the ceiling makes the creation and use of a rope bridge very dangerous.\n\nAnything that falls into the magma river takes 3D6 damage.\n\nA ramp at the other side may be used during the [escape](#escape) if remembered.\n\n## The Killing Floor {#killing_floor}\n\nThis chamber is distinct to the rest of the cave. \nIt has a very low ceiling, is fairly narrow, and long.\nIt is wide enough to fit a car though.\nScattered around are columns made of crystalline iridescent [Bismuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth).\nSmall cracks of flowing magma line the floor providing a small amount of light.\n\nA [METAL ORE TALOS](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#ore_talos) consisting of bismuth waits in the middle of the room.\nIt stands as a silent and hidden sentry, ready to kill any intruders, the team and DOT raiders alike.\nIt is well disguised but has one less ARMOR due to the brittleness of bismuth.\n\nThe bismuth columns can be used as 2 ARMOR cover.\nHowever, the ARMOR rating is reduced by 1 when used to negate armor as the bismuth is chipped away.\n\n## The Pillar\n\nThis room is dark and empty except for its one central feature.\nAn intimidating hex shaped obsidian column reaches from the floor to the ceiling.\nCracks line across its surface.\nMagma flows up these tracks from under the floor.\n\nThese have been created by the [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) to reactivate the dormant volcano at Warboys.\n\n## The Raider's Chamber {#raider_chamber}\n\nThe Raider's Chamber is packed with ramshackle shelters and old cars.\nIt is in a state of major disrepair as columns of magma flow down from the ceiling.\nTaloes have recently attacked before they made their way to the Reservoir Chamber.\n\n### Forces\n\nThe surviving group is led by an [ELDER DOTTER OF TARTARUS](/Tartarus/Dotters.qmd#elder_dotter) called Axel.\nTheir standing force consists of 1D6 [TARTARUS RAIDERS](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#raider), and 2 [TARTARUS MUTANTS](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#tartarus_mutant).\nThere are many more injured and dead.\n\n### Desperation\n\nEvery so often a new [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOS](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) emerges from the magma to attack the settlement.\nThe DOT raiders want to escape.\nTheir own only choices are to leave via the surface or back deeper into the DOT.\nThey know they will be captured if they go to the surface.\nThe only way deeper into the DOT is through the Reservoir Chamber containing Taloes that will destroy them.\n\n### Negotation\n\nThe raiders are willing to negotiate with the team. \nThey will not leave the chamber until there is a safe route to the DOT.\nAdditionally, they won't leave the surface route unguarded.\nThey initially let the team through the [Overlook Chamber](#overlook_chamber) unharmed so they could parley.\n\nAxel will offer the following weapon as immediate payment if the team agrees to take care of the Taloes in the Reservoir Chamber.\n\n[Panzerschreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzerschreck) Rocket launcher (1D6+2 DAMAGE, LOUD)\n\n__LOUD__ weapon tag: Attacks with this weapon draw the undivided attention of enemies within earshot (and instantly reveal your position).\n\nIf the players try to negotiate Axel may also offer one or both of the following:\n\n1. Reinforced silver fire suit (1 ARMOR)\n2. Lending the players a [TARTARUS MUTANT](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#tartarus_mutant) for the fight ahead\n\nIf the players agree, the raiders will pack their goods and injured into their vehicles so they are ready to escape through the [Reservoir Chamber](#reservoir).\nBefore the team leave Axel will inform them that the Taloes took some live recon agents and raiders, totalling 6, into the [Reservoir Chamber](#reservoir).\nThey also warn that once the Taloes are slain this part of the DOT will start to crumble and the team will need to be ready to retreat back to the surface.\nIf they are not quick enough the caves will collapse and the new entrance of the DOT will disappear preventing their escape.\n\n## Mile long corridor\n\nA mile long corridor leads from the [Raider's Chamber](#raider_chamber) to the [Reservoir Chamber](#reservoir).\n\n## The Reservoir {#reservoir}\n\nThe chamber is a roughly circular chamber with uneven flooring and large organised pillars. \nIn the middle there is one large hexagonal pillar of obsidian, cracks oozing with magma. \nAround the pillar is a mote of magma.\nThe magma is going towards and up into the pillar.\n\n### The Volcano reawakening\n\n6 [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) surround the pillar performing a ritual.\nAs the team enters they hear the screams of recon members and raiders being hurled into the magma mote.\nThe caves start to shake as the magma flow increases in speed.\nEach Talos starts creating a smaller obsidian pillar at the 6 edges of the large pillar.\nIf their ritual is not stopped the volcano will reawaken.\nThe village of Warboy will be destroyed and England will be blanketed in a volcanic fog.\n\n### Combat\n\nDuring combat the Taloes like to carry out 2 main tactics.\nCreate cover with the abundance of lava and throw their spears whilst defended.\nConversely, some will charge their enemies with arm blades.\n\nIf 6 [OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES](/Tartarus/Taloes.qmd#obsidian_talos) is not enough for the challenge you would like, more can emerge from the central magam mote.\n\n## Escape {#escape}\n\nOnce the Taloes have been defeated the caves will start to collapse.\nIf the team sided with the DOT raiders they will drive through and thank them.\nThey will pick up any Raiders who helped the team in the fight and present the team with a rusted dune buggy to escape with.\n\n__DUNE BUGGY__: 8 HP, 1 ARMOR.\n\nWhilst escaping ask for various rolls to avoid lava, falling rocks, and stalagmites in the various rooms they travel through. The Dune buggy will be able to fit through The [Raider's Chamber](#raider_chamber), The [Killing Floor](#killing_floor), [The River](#river) and the [Overlook Chamber](#overlook_chamber).\n\nOnce they have retreated to the surface the new entrance to the DOT will collapse and the team will have successfully complete the mission.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](images/DELVE.png){width=30% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Mission\n\nDue to an earthquake a new cave has appeared at the extinct volcano near the village [Warboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warboys#Geology), England.\nThis cave has an entrance to the [DOT](/Tartarus/tartarus.qmd) and [DOT raiders](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd) have recently ransacked the town.\n\nThe military are currently setting up a quarantine and building a protective wall around the cave.
