I also encourage you to improv based on the suggestions of your players.\n\n### The Aurora\n\n__The Aurora__ is a ski resort run by the __Daman__ family. \nThe main building is a post-modern brutalism building of concrete and colour.\nThe __Damans__ have been told to accommodate the team and help with intel gathering.\n\nSome possible clues include:\n\n- __Security guards:__ Know the locations and dates of skier and snowboarder deaths. Each was skiing/snowboarding in the dark before being found dead. Some bodies were not found at all.\n- __Suns of Nyxmera:__ A group stargazes every night on top of the resort building. They have noticed localised Auroras. Many match nights when people went missing/found dead.\n\nThe team can freely rent and use snow mobiles (3 HP, 2 ARMOR) and other skiing/snowboarding gear provided by __The Aurora__ during the mission.\n\n### Skifry\n\n__Skifry__ is a secluded mountain town with a logo of a purple dragon bathed by the aurora.\nThe town was founded in these mountains due to the underground hot springs acting as a natural way to heat the town and produce electricity.\nUnfortunately, the underground hot springs are also the reason the cryophilic snow worms can so easily survive the cold climate here.\n\n__The Aurora__, on the outskirts of the town, makes use of the hot water and town citizens.\n\nSome possible clues include:\n\n- __Library in the city hall:__ News articles about a radio tower abandoned in the 30s due to unexplained animal attacks.\n- __Recruiters for cult:__ Will try to recruit the players to the cult. They are careful and coy as they are currently normal humans.\n- __Hospital & morgue:__ Recent body of a victim.\n- __Indigenous centre:__ The resident storyteller has the following story if asked about tales of worms.\n  - The native Waawate & Icelandic Jokla were a warlock pair of great power. They vanquished the mighty ice worm. Waawate summoned the Northern lights to attract the beast. Then Jokla encased it in ice.\n- __Strange shopper:__ A strange very wrapped up individual ([MUTATED CULTIST OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist)) going into the food store to buy a lot of meat, potatoes, and canned food.\n\n\n## Outpost\n\nOnce the team is ready they can make their way to the Cult's outpost. \n\nAll enemy stats and items are in the following page: [Cult of Skyuss](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd).\n\nThe Cult of Skyuss' outpost is an abandoned radio tower within a forest.\nThe forest is a mile above the ski slopes, on top of a ridge. \nAn old road leads to it but otherwise snow mobiles can be used to reach the outpost.\n\nThe outpost is a nondescript square concrete building.\nIt consists of 2 floors with an inner outdoor square dominated by a radio tower.\nThe outpost is surrounded by a barbed wire topped fence with one gate. \nIts insides and outsides are littered with detritus and garbage. \nThe cult intentionally lets it look dilapidated so it appears abandoned.\n\nWhilst approaching the outpost the team may be spotted by the patrolling [MUTATED CULTIST OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist) through outside facing windows on the first floor.\n\nInside the outpost murmurings can be heard from all directions.\nIt is kept stiflingly hot with large radiators lining the walls.\nA strong musky smell permeates the entire air, somewhat covering the smell of mould and rot from all the garbage.\nThe concrete walls are heavily cracked with sloppy patch jobs.\n\nA large SUV (8 HP, 1 ARMOR) is covered by the garbage outside but within the fence.\n\nIf the team are in active combat, make a Choke roll for __Anne Lida__ ([DEACON OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_deacon)) every time a [MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist) dies.\n\n### Ground floor\n\nThe ground floor contains 6 rooms (R) with one hallway (H) circling the inner walls. \nThe rooms only connect to the hallway (except one which has a staircase). \nA pair of [MUTATED CULTIST OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist) patrol the hall and rooms.\n\nWhen entering a room (R) use a D6 to determine which room it is from the below list. \nEnsure there is only one of each of the 6 rooms.\n\n  1. __Room with stairs:__ Leads to the next floor's hallway.\n  2. __Incubation room:__ 3 [INCUBATOR CULTISTS OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_incubator).\n  3. __Incubation room:__ 2 [INCUBATOR CULTISTS OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_incubator).\n  4. __Recreation room:__ Contains a table with some cards.\n  5. __Cult of Skyuss prayer room:__ Has a library with books about the worm eating the planet and Gaian philosophy books.\n  6. __Boiler room:__ If the boiler is disabled the cultists will desperately try to fix it.

The rooms only connect to the hallway (except one which connects to the radio tower). 4 [MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist) patrol the halls and rooms, keeping an eye out on the outside via large windows. Another 4 [MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS](/Gaia/Skyuss.qmd#skyuss_mutated_cultist) are awake but on break in various rooms (R).\n\nWhen entering a room use a D6 to determine which room it is from the below list.
