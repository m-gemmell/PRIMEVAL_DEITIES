Do not kill, harm, or kidnap any civilians except the target during a mission unless the client allows it.\n2. Do not kill, harm, or kidnap any other Camera Obscura shutterbugs. This is important as Camera Obscura will normally send multiple shutterbugs for one mission, only paying out to one individual/group.\n3. Non-shutterbug mercenaries, bodyguards, and vigilantes are fair game to eliminate.\n\nThese rules lead to team ups and rivalries aplenty.\n\n\n9 HP \\| 1 ARMOR \\| EYES : +1 \\| JAWS : 0 \\| LIMBS : -1 \\| NERVES : +1\n\nCHOKE 4: Escape with their jetpack\n\n- Special organ grinder containing below secret weapons (accessory)\n  - Hand cranked chain gun (1D6+1 DAMAGE)\n  - Knock out gas hose (1 use)\n  - Net gun (1 use) \n- Hidden bullet proof vest (1 armor)\n- Tacky outfit to hide amongst other street performers (cowboy, cyberpunk, presidents etc.)\n\n__INSTRUMENTAL:__ This kidnappers secret weapon is their box organ grinder with an assortment of secret devices.

Poisoning everyone's food is a cinch. The ANTIDOTER uses a special 2 part poison they have an antidote for. One part is harmless. Consuming both parts within four hours of each other causes a deadly heart attack within a few minutes. The poisons are undetectable but a special antidote administered after the first or second part will prevent death.\n\n__PSIONIC PIPES (BOSS MOVE):__ Only works on individuals who have consumed at least one part of the poison. Attracts non-targets and repels target/s. This requires a lot of concentration whilst they are maintaining this effect. Trained individuals may be able to notice this effect. Once everyone is in place they will use their fog machine to spread the antidote to non targets.\n\n## THE KING {#the_king}\n\n4 HP \\| EYES : +1 \\| JAWS : -1 \\| LIMBS : -1 \\| NERVES : +2\n\nPANIC 2: Lifts midas touch curse and barters for mercy with pilfered goods\n\n- Deck of cards\n- Lock picking tools\n- Great sleight of hand and distraction skills\n- Covered in pilfered jewellery\n- Will not wear gold\n- Simple but stylish dress\n\n__CONCEITED:__ Their real identity is [Queen Hermodike II/Damodice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermodike_II), the wife of [King Midas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midas). \nTurned into gold by her husband she was changed back by Nyxmera in the modern day.\nTheir rage towards their late husband means they only target the rich and greedy. \nThey are vain, prideful, and beautiful. \nUsing a portfolio of personaes they have infiltrated into various upper social circles. \nThey can't help themselves from stealing jewellery and immediately wearing it. \nTheir overbearing charisma stops the vast majority from questioning or confronting THE KING about this. \n\n__MIDAS TOUCH (BOSS MOVE):__ They can imbue one gold item and one person with the Midas curse. THE KING must touch the gold and person at the same time to cast the curse. If and when the cursed person willingly touches the cursed gold the victim will permanently turn into solid gold. Any other person touching the cursed gold and/or person during the transformation will also turn to gold.
