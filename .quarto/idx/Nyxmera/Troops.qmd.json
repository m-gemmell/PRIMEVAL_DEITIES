They will shoot allies and enemies alike with their laser rifles. When dealing damage with these they harm the target on even totals and heal the target on odd totals.

It must be continuously fired whilst the user is illuminated. Due to the weight of the hard light the wall must be kept on the ground for normal humans.

It will bide its time for the best opportunity to reveal itself based on how cool it would be. If it begins a fight with no backup it will take no DAMAGE from the first attack against them, doing a narly flip or trick to evade it.\n\n__LIGHT__ weapon tag: Weighs almost nothing.
