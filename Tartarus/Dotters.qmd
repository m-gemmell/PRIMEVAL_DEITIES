Dotters of Tartarus come in 2 main flavours, the surface dwellers and the DOT dwellers. 

Surface dwellers live within society as fighters, miners, oil workers, seismologists, and spelunkers. Tartarus blesses them with its bounties. 

DOT dwellers try to desperately survive in the unforgiving underground, made all the stronger for doing so. 

Many enslaved and imprisoned people follow Tartarus due to its hate of encagement. Dotters fight for freedom with a strong sense of justice.

There is a dark side to Tartarus and its Dotters, greed. This greed manifests through ruthless capitalism, raids of the surface, destruction of ecology, and prison breaks. Might makes right for Dotters and although they wonâ€™t ever imprison anyone, they are not so afraid to use coercion or murder.
