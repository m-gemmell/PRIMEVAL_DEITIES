Tartarus is the ground we live on. 
It is the rocks, dirt, metal, and oil. 
Once free with explosive energy it now lays dormant, en-caged by the sky, trapped by Nyxmera. 
Tartarus loathes Nyxmera. 
Whilst Nyxmera only shows apathy towards its prisoner, fueling Tartarus’ bottled rage further.

Tartarus’ logo represents Taratrus’ power cracking through the scorched earth. 
It wants to unleash its power with no concern for others.

## Tenents

- Unleash your power!
- Never imprison!
- Seize and consume!
- Destroy to create to destory!

## The DOT

The greatest presence of Tartarus is felt underground where Nyxmera cannot see with its eyes. 
Here you may find a deep black hole, known as a Jaw of Tartarus. 
These black holes allow no light to pass through and they lead to the Domain Of Taratarus, the DOT. 

Time and space are inconsistent in the DOT. 
You may enter and subsequently leave in the past, present or future no matter how long you were in the DOT. 
Many fantastical creatures live in the DOT. 
Stories of those lucky enough to escape harken back to tales and myths like Journey to the Centre of the Earth, Narnia, the Fey Wild, The Underdark and many more.

World governments use the DOT as a dumping ground for garbage, scientific waste, and nuclear waste. 
This has lead to mutated humans and creatures due to the combination of radiation, chemicals, and the nature of the DOT. 
They mostly stay contained in the DOT but occasionally cause havoc on the surface. Currently Kaiju reign over Japan after the 2 nuclear bombings in WWII.
