Taloes (singular = [talos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos)) of Tartarus are animated beings made from the bounties of Tartarus. 
They generally consist of local resources.
With varying levels of intelligence they tend to either work for a Dotter master or carry out the will of Tartarus.

## LITHIUM TALOS {#litium_talos}

3 HP | 2D6 appear | EYES : -2 | JAWS : +1 | LIMBS : 0 | NERVES : -3

- Explosive spit (1D6 DAMAGE)

__CASCADE:__ These blobs of lithium like to hide in crevasses and behind rocks. They will wait till their prey are surrounded by them before attacking. When they die they explode for 3 DAMAGE, this may cause a cascade of explosions from all the LITHIUM TALOES. Many cave-ins have been known to occur due to this.

## METAL ORE TALOS {#ore_talos}

11 HP | 2 ARMOR | EYES : -1 | JAWS : +2 | LIMBS : -1 | NERVES : -3

- Heavy machine gun (1D6+2 DAMAGE)
- Warhammer (1D6+2 DAMAGE, MESSY)
- Ore body (2 ARMOR)
- Mostly stationary and slow to react
- A crude approximation of a human in metal ore form. 

__TOWER:__ It is a crude approximation of a human form made of dirt and local ores. Instead of legs, its body is a great pillar that can slowly shuffle over the ground. Although slow in movement they compensate with their unrelenting fire. If its enemies take cover it will slowly approach and destroy the cover with its warhammer dealing 2 DAMAGE from shrapnel to those behind it.

__MESSY__ weapon tag: Enemies explode into gore/goo/scrap etc. on ultra successes (in addition to the usual bonus). No identifiers will remainâ€”not even teeth. ([F:UE](https://claymorerpgs.itch.io/fist))

## OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOS {#obsidian_talos}

6 HP | 1 ARMOR | EYES : 0 | JAWS : +1 | LIMBS : +1 | NERVES : -1

- Obsidian arm blades (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Obsidian lava spear (1D6+2 DAMAGE, talos takes one damage when it creates one, 1 use)
- Obsidian scales (1 ARMOR)
- Fast, and ruthless

__GLASSBLOWER:__ The true form of this talos is lava. The talos can change any lava that is part of it or touches it to obsidian of any shape. With this ability it creates an obsidian based skeleton, armor, and weapons. Additionally, it can change obsidian back into lava. 

## RADIOACTIVE GEM TALOS {#rad_talos}

9 HP | 2 ARMOR | EYES : 0 | JAWS : +2 | LIMBS : +1 | NERVES : 0

- Plasma rifle (1D6+2 DAMAGE, ENERGY-HUNGRY)
- Arm mounted power drills (1D6+2 DAMAGE, DIG)
- Power armor (2 ARMOR, ENERGY-HUNGRY)
- Quartz, amethyst, violet fluorite, blue salt, yellow sapphires or green diamond core.
- Voice like a Geiger counter

__PROJECTION:__ A radioactive projection produced from a single gem at their core. Although the most human looking of all the taloes they are also the most terrifying. They give off constant nuclear radiation which they use to power their weapons and armor. Anyone within melee range gets -2 to action rolls and loses 1HP per action.

__GEM:__ Their real body is their core which has 3HP. If this is not destroyed the talos will reform in 1D6 days. Its gear is not part of its projection.

__DIG__ weapon tag: Able to dig through solid rock, allowing traversal.

__ENERGY-HUNGRY__ tag: Requires a a large amount of energy to function.
