The elusive ever adaptable deity of water. 
Proteus goes with the flow, loathing stagnation and overworking. 
Proteus is ever changing, and agreeable, happy to be manipulated by others. 
Whether forming into cloud by the sun, falling down a mountain, or becoming steam by lava water will change. 

When it is affected by others it will also leave its own mark. 
Beaches formed by the interaction of the moon, water, and land. 
Clouds blocking the sun. 
The formation of Islands with magma. 
In this changing way, Proteus brings life but it can take it away. 
However Proteus requires balance, it is frozen in the absence of heat and evaporates with too much.

## Tenents

- Flow like water to adapt
- Allow others to shape you
- Respect others autonomy
- Perserverance allows great deeds

## Holy water

[Holy water](/Proteus/Triton_n_Delta.qmd#holy_water) is extracted from the avatars of Proteus known as [Water Bodies](/Proteus/Water_bodies.qmd).
It is an illicit paranormal drug that allows the user to see the flow of time.
This can be used by artists to allow a new outlook on life.
It can also be used by athletes, fighters, and soldiers to give a tactical advantage.
However, an overdose of Holy water leads to the user turning into water.

## Proteans

The followers of Proteus are called Proteans. 
Proteans can be found on the waters as sailors, water sports enthusiasts, and navy men.
On the land they can be found as pharmaceutical workers, dealers and enjoyers of alcohol and drugs, snow sports enthusiasts, sanitation workers, climatologists, and firefighters.

Due to their philosophies their organisations tend to be smaller and collaborative. 
Proteans play well and you will regularly see them team up with other faction organisations. 

## Sub Factions

There are many Protean sub factions, many of them being a combination with one of the other three.

- [Proteans](/Proteus/Proteans.qmd): Typical Proteans.
- [Triton & Delta](/Proteus/Triton_n_Delta.qmd): A large pharmaceutical company with Gaians. They sell both licit and illicit drugs, including being the number one supplier of Holy water.
- [Refraction Sports](/Proteus/Refraction_Sports.qmd): A sports company specialising in snow and water sports. Suns of Nyxmera are involved.
- [Pumice construction Ltd.](/Proteus/Pumice_construction_ltd.qmd): A Protean and Dotters of Nyxmera construction company. Their revolutionary concrete technology has allowed the post modern brutalism boom.
- [Water bodies](/Proteus/Water_bodies.qmd): Physical manifestations of earthly water bodies (rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, etc.).
- [Blanchard the Hyperborean](/Proteus/Blanchard_the_hyperborean.qmd): One of the chief lieutenants of [Dr. Petra Pufferfish](/Gaia/Dr_Petra_Pufferfish.qmd). He aids her plans of world domination with his mind controlled animals and icy weather technologies.
