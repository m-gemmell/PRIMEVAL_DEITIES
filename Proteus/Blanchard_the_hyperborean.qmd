Blanchard is known as the Hyperborean.
He is one of the 3 chief lieutenants of [Dr. Petra Pufferfish](/Gaia/Dr_Petra_Pufferfish), the Primeval Polytheist.
He is an Ice themed super villain who's knowledge of cryogenics is untouched by anyone else.
Although a genius he is a very large, active strong man having won the first World's strongest man compettion in 1977.

His family moved from Austria to Texas when he was a young child.
His fascination of cold came from his family visits to the snowy mountains of Austria.
He wanted to create technologies to temporarily freeze trauma patients, create temporary relief housing, and even sentient snow creatures.
His dreams were never realised, his efforts always crushed by large companies such as [Pumice construction]() and [Triton & Delta](/Proteus/Triton_n_Delta.qmd) who didn't want the competition.

His one success is a company specialising in high protein frozen desserts.
Although this made him a fortune he was left unfulfilled.
So he joined [Dr. Petra Pufferfish](/Gaia/Dr_Petra_Pufferfish) and learnt meterology so he could ransom the USA with snow storms.

## BLANCHARD THE HYPERBOREAN {#blanchard}

8 HP | 2 ARMOR | EYES : 0 | JAWS : +2 | LIMBS : +2 | NERVES : +1

- Freezeray attached to backpack with heatpump design (1D6+3, STUN)
- [Glock 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock) (1D6, PROTOTYPE, MELT)
- Sharp Ice knuckleduster gloves (1D6+1 DAMAGE)
- Ice suit (2 ARMOR, ARMOR reduced by 1 when dealt 3 heat based DAMAGE)
- Rocket powered ice skates
- Body like an Austrian body builder
- 2 Instant ice wall generators (accessory)
- Snow goggles, Prevents snow blindness and allows greater visibility in blizzards. Additionally, allows user to see through ice up to 1 metre thick.

__FLOE__: At first glance Blanchard seems to contradict Proteus' edict of going with the flow. However, surface ice belies the activity underneath it. Cold water contains more oxygen so life can grow larger. Ice and snow flows slowly and its beauty is blinding. Blanchard cannot be harmed by the cold or cold/ice/snow based weapons.

__SNOW DAY (BOSS MOVE):__ Blanchard summons a blizzard, harshly reducing visibility.

__ICE FORTS (BOSS MOVE):__ If he is on an icy surface, Blanchard can create randomly scattered ice blocks. These act as destructible 2 ARMOR cover.

__PROTOYPE__ weapon tag: Wielding this next-generation weapon grants +1 TACTICAL; roll +TAC to attack with it. ([F:UE](https://claymorerpgs.itch.io/fist))

__MELT__ weapon tag: Weapon (melee) or projectiles (firearm) are made from a non-metallic substance that will melt over time. DAMAGE NEGATION by ARMOR is doubled for this weapon.

## SNOWBALL SWARM {#snowball_swarm}

3 HP | 2D6 appear | EYES : -3 | JAWS : 0 | LIMBS : +1 | NERVES : -3

- [Glock 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock)
- A swarm of flying snowballs wielding Glocks

__Superorganism:__ A superorganism is a creature made up of many different individuals, such as the snowball swarm. They are simple creatures only looking to kill their enemies. Snowball swarms only take 1 DAMAGE from ranged weapons with low RPM (rounds per minute) and no spread (e.g. bows, pistols, bolt-action rifles, sniper rifles etc). 

__SYNERGISE (BOSS MOVE):__ The snowball swarm combines with another snowball swarm. The resulting snowball's HP is equal to the sum of the merged snowball swarms.

## CYBORG ORCA {#cyborg_orca}

- Cyborg exoskeleton (2 ARMOR)
- Mind altering starfish in a protective dome (2HP, 4 ARMOR)
- Echolocation sensors and laser communications

__CEDATED:__ This cetacean has a parasitic starfish embedded on its skull. This forces it to listen to the commands of an ORCA WRANGLER. It does so with ruthless efficiency. CYBORG ORCAS share their echolocation data with their pod and wrangler via laser communications. Orcas freed from their starfish will attempt to bite the starfish off other Orcas to free them.

__STUN__ weapon tag: Those damaged by this weapon cannot move or act until their current HP changes. ([F:UE](https://claymorerpgs.itch.io/fist))

__WRANGLER:__ The ORCA WRANGLER is piloted by a human and starfish that have become one. The ORCA WRANGLER is able to control a pod of 6 CYBORG ORCAS who stay close to the wrangler at all times. Each arm of the vehicle acts as the communicator between the wrangler and 1 CYBORG ORCA. If an arm is destroyed a CYBORG ORCA is freed, roll a D6 to determine which one.

## CYBORG POLAR BEAR {#cyborg_polar_bear}

- Titanium claws (1D6+2 DAMAGE)
- Side mounted LMGs (1D6+2 DAMAGE)
- Cyborg armor (2 ARMOR)

__TARGETTED-FRENZY:__ Polar bears are frightening. Cyborg polar bears with riders that control what they see, hear, and smell are terrifying. Cyborg polar bears freed of their reality altering helmets? Horrifying for the rider and everyone else in its line of sight.

__PRIMAL-FEAR__ weapon tag: When used on animals it will induce fear & obedience. However, it has a 1-in-1D6 chance of enraging the animal instead.
