## PROTEAN {#protean}

3HP | EYES : -1 | JAWS : -1 | LIMBS : +1 | NERVES : -1

PANIC 5: Find the nearest source of water to submerge in

- Compass
- Dowsing rods
- Beanie & deck shoes
- Callused hands from rowing

__CALM:__ Proteans are naturally calm individuals. They are easy going and very agreeable. However, they don't like dry places and tend to congregate where it is wet or humid. Most are natural born sailors and rowers.

## PROTEAN CAPTAIN {#protean_captain}

3 HP | EYES : 0 | JAWS : -1 | LIMBS : +1 | NERVES : 0

PANIC 6: Yell commands at others who will be compelled to obey

- Ice daggers (1D6 DAMAGE, MELT) that CAPTAIN can materialise from water or air
- Steam spray from hands and feet (allows limited propulsion and fall negation)
- Gills & lungs
- Key to their yacht
- Sailing attire

__DELEGATOR:__ PROTEAN CAPTAINS are leaders amongst Proteans. They manage this by being lazy and telling everybody else what to do. Their clear communication and relaxing presence can be a boon in stressful environments. This leads them to being ship captains, sports coaches, managers, and various other leadership roles. They put up with these roles so they can afford fine luxury ships and their crew.

__MELT__ weapon tag: Weapon (melee) or projectiles (firearm) are made from a non-metallic substance that will melt over time. DAMAGE NEGATION by ARMOR is doubled for this weapon.
